# Project Name
StudyGroups

# What is it?
This project proposal is to create an app to allow students to study in real life together with others, and also to create stronger friendships for students outside of class. Students attending city campus universities may have a hard time meeting new people which leads to weaker connections outside of class, even more if they commute to class. This app will help connect students, and will incentivize students to meet as they will also study for their classes. 

# For whom?
This software will be mainly for students in university. 

# How?
We would start with the user creating a profile. The profile will include their name, picture, university, age/year, major, and classes. Once a profile is created, there would be different UX/UI designs for different subjects. Each "major/subject" will have it's own section, and in the subject's page, there will be different classes, with an option to add a class if it doesn't exist in the app. If an user were to click a page, they would be able to select a time and location, which will then prompt the app to send a notification to other users with the same class seeing if any other users are interested in a study session. Afterwards, users can give feedback on the user, and the study session, giving a point system (like uber) for users.  

# Scope
This seems like an app that would take a long time to program. In retrospect, it does seem like Uber, but its specific target audience will be smaller, although open to anyone studying. Having the app being similar to Uber showcases the difficulty of programming it.
